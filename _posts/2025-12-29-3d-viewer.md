I've added a new app to the [Simple](/simple/) collection: **3DViewer**.

It's a native macOS app for viewing 3D model files — think of it like Preview, but for 3D models.

## Features

3DViewer is built with SwiftUI and SceneKit and includes:

- **Multiple format support** — opens STL, OBJ, USDZ, PLY, and DAE files
- **Interactive controls** — orbit, pan, and zoom to examine models from any angle
- **Wireframe mode** — toggle to inspect model structure
- **Auto-centering** — models are automatically scaled and centered for optimal viewing
- **Grid floor** — provides spatial reference while viewing
- **Light/dark mode** — follows your system theme

No external dependencies — just Apple's built-in frameworks for a lightweight, fast experience.
