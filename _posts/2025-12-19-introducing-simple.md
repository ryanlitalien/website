I've added a new section to my site: [Simple](/simple/).

It's a home for small, focused macOS utilities that I build and use myself. Nothing fancy — just tools that do one thing well.

## MarkdownViewer

The first app is **MarkdownViewer** — a native macOS app for viewing Markdown files. Think of it like Preview, but for `.md` files.

It supports the full Markdown spec (headers, code blocks, tables, task lists, etc.), has dark mode, and works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.
