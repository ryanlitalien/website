I've added a new app to the [Simple](/simple/) collection: **JSONViewer**.

It's a native macOS app for viewing JSON files — think of it like Preview for images, but for `.json` files.

## Features

JSONViewer is built with SwiftUI and includes:

- **Syntax highlighting** — color-coded keys, strings, numbers, booleans, and null values
- **Expand/collapse** — click the arrows to collapse objects and arrays
- **Error detection** — invalid JSON shows an error banner with the problematic line highlighted
- **Copy to clipboard** — one-click copy of the raw JSON
- **Light/dark mode** — follows your system theme

Like MarkdownViewer, it's lightweight, focused, and just works.
